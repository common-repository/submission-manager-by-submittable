Allows Submittable clients to easily integrate their submission forms with any self-hosted WordPress website.

== Description ==

Submittable integrates with your website to provide a clean, organized system for all types of file submissions. Use Submittable to receive, store, and share editorial, resumes, applications, contest entries, portfoliosâ€”any type of digital file!

Submission Manager:

*   Receive and manage all types of digital content: editorial, contest entries, applications, business plans, portfolios
*   Earn revenue and increase quality by accepting payment with submissions
*   Store files over time with no hosting costs
*   Review your submissions on iPad, iPhone, and Kindle

Submittable WordPress Plugin Notes:

*   Only loads CSS files for pages where the [submittable] shortcode is found (NO BLOAT!)
*   Translation-ready!
*   Your pages can be un-branded (no reference to Submittable)
*   Default CSS can be disabled, allowing you to fully customize your results look/feel
*   Choose whether or not you want to show your submission fees (if they exist).

== Installation ==

Installing the Submittable WordPress Plugin is easy.

1. Download and then upload plugin files to your plugins folder, or install using WordPress' built-in Add New Plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin in your WordPress dashboard (under Plugins)
3. Go to the plugin settings page (under Settings > Submittable)
4. Enter the sub domain of your Submittable URL. For example, if your URL is http://MyOrganization.submittable.com, the subdomain is "MyOrganization". Then configure the other settings as needed.
5. Create a new Page. Enter the Submittable shortcode into that page: [submittable] 
   Note: You can now add the code [submittable] to any WordPress page where you would like your submission categories (or job listings) display. (Do not use the short code more than once on a page)

Links to your Submittable submission forms are now listed directly on the Page/Post of your choice.
